This is a CodeSkulptor 3 game made in python. You can play it by going here: https://py3.codeskulptor.org and pasting in the code. 
This was a group first year project, but I was the sole contributor for all core code, refactoring, and technical implementation. 
All code in this repository reflects my individual work.
